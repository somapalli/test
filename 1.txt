Example 1: Flat Rate Pricing

Scenario:

A small online business, "Cozy Crafts," sells handmade goods through its website and via phone orders. They use a virtual terminal for the phone orders.

Cozy Crafts has moderate transaction volume, averaging around $5,000 in sales per month, with an average order value of $50.

Pricing Model:

The virtual terminal provider offers a flat rate of 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.

How it Works:

Transaction: A customer calls and places an order for $75 worth of goods.

Calculation:

Fee = (2.9% of $75) + $0.30

Fee = ($2.175) + $0.30

Fee = $2.475 (rounded to $2.48)

Cost to Cozy Crafts: Cozy Crafts will pay $2.48 in fees for this transaction. They will receive $72.52 in their account.

Monthly Cost: If they process 100 transactions averaging 

        50eachmonth(50eachmonth(
      
5,000 total), the estimated costs are:
2.9% of $5000 = $145

100 x $0.30 = $30

Total Fees = $145 + $30 = $175

Total revenue = $5,000 - $175 = $4,825

Key Takeaways for Flat Rate:

Simple to understand.

Predictable costs allow Cozy Crafts to easily budget.

Suitable for their volume and average transaction size.

Example 2: Custom Pricing

Scenario:

"Global Corp," is a B2B company that supplies equipment parts to factories globally and uses a virtual terminal to process large POs.

Global Corp has a very high monthly transaction volume of $500,000 with an average transaction size of $5,000.

They consistently submit Level 3 data.

Pricing Model:

Global Corp negotiates a custom pricing structure that includes multiple rate adjustments for different transaction types. The negotiated structure is:

Level 3 Qualified: Interchange + 0.10% + $0.15 per transaction.

Level 2 Qualified: Interchange + 0.25% + $0.20 per transaction.

Non-Qualified: Interchange + 0.75% + $0.30 per transaction.

How it Works:

Transaction 1 (Level 3 Qualified): $8,000 order, and all Level 3 Data included. The interchange for this transaction based on the card type is 1.8%

Fees: (1.8% + 0.10%) of $8,000 + $0.15

Fees: $152 + $8 + $0.15

Total Fees: $160.15

Transaction 2 (Level 2 Qualified): $6,000 order, and Level 2 Data included, but not Level 3 Data. The interchange for this transaction based on the card type is 2%

Fees: (2% + 0.25%) of $6,000 + $0.20

Fees: $120 + $15 + $0.20

Total Fees: $135.20

Transaction 3 (Non-Qualified): $200 order that failed some qualification steps, not providing Level 2 or Level 3 Data. The interchange for this transaction based on the card type is 2.5%

Fees: (2.5% + 0.75%) of $200 + $0.30

Fees: $5.00 + $1.50 + $0.30

Total Fees: $6.80

Monthly Costs: It's difficult to give an exact monthly cost without knowing the specific mix of transactions. However, assuming that 80% of transactions are Level 3, 15% Level 2, and 5% non-qualified, and assuming all transactions average $5000 would calculate to the following:

Monthly Volume: $500,000

Number of transactions $500,000 / $5,000 = 100 transactions

Level 3 transactions = 80 transactions = (1.8% + 0.10% + $.15) x 80 x $5000 = $7,200 + $400 + $12 = $7,612

Level 2 transactions = 15 transactions = (2% + 0.25% + $.20) x 15 x $5000 = $1,500 + $187.50 + $3 = $1,690.50

Non Qualified transactions = 5 transactions = (2.5% + 0.75% + $.30) x 5 x $5000 = $625 + $187.50 + $1.50 = $814

Total monthly fees: $7,612 + $1,690.50 + $814 = $10,116.50

Total revenue: $500,000 - $10,116.50 = $489,883.50

Key Takeaways for Custom Pricing:

Complexity, the rates can vary significantly based on the data provided and the card type.

The potential to greatly reduce costs for qualifying transactions.

Requires careful tracking and management of transaction data.

Requires ongoing analysis to ensure cost savings are achieved.

The fees can fluctuate widely.

Example 3: Subscription Model with Processing Fees

Scenario:

"Tech Solutions," is a consulting company that often processes payments via phone or manually.

They only process a small amount of transactions per month, and their monthly processing is inconsistent.

They require access to a reliable virtual terminal without complicated rate structures.

Pricing Model:

Tech Solutions pays a monthly subscription fee of $50 for access to the virtual terminal.

Transaction fees are set at 3.25% + $0.25 per transaction.

How it Works:

Transaction: Tech Solutions processes a $200 payment using the virtual terminal.

Calculation:

Fee = (3.25% of $200) + $0.25

Fee = $6.50 + $0.25

Fee = $6.75

Cost to Tech Solutions: Tech Solutions will pay $6.75 in processing fees for this transaction + $50 for access to the virtual terminal per month.

Monthly Cost: If they process 10 transactions a month with an average ticket of $200, their monthly costs would be:

$50 (monthly fee)

10 transactions x $6.75 = $67.50

Total Fees: $50 + $67.50 = $117.50

Key Takeaways for Subscription with Processing:

Good for low volume businesses with low transactions.

Simple and easy to manage.

Good for businesses that need access to software but do not use it consistently.

Key Points:

These examples are simplified to illustrate the key points of each model.

Actual rates and fees may vary significantly between providers.

Always obtain a detailed breakdown of all fees and charges.

Always thoroughly understand any contracts and agreements you enter into.

Negotiation is usually a key factor for high-volume businesses.

In Summary

These examples demonstrate that flat-rate pricing works well for smaller businesses or those with simple requirements. Custom pricing is valuable for high-volume businesses that can optimize their data and manage their transactions well. Subscription models work well for businesses with low processing needs and the desire to have a low-cost software option. Before choosing any option, ensure you compare various virtual terminal options and understand the details of each pricing structure. This will ensure the best fit for your business.

Example 4: Interchange-Plus Pricing

Scenario:

"Tech Supplies Inc." is a business that sells computer parts to other businesses. They utilize a virtual terminal to take phone orders and process mailed purchase orders.

Tech Supplies has a varying transaction volume of around $20,000 monthly, with average order sizes ranging from $100 to $1,000, and a variety of credit card types.

Pricing Model:

The virtual terminal provider uses an interchange-plus model with the following markup:

Interchange + 0.15% + $0.10 per transaction.

How it Works:

Transaction 1 (Debit Card): A small business pays with a regular debit card; $150 order. The interchange rate for a debit card in this instance is 0.05% + $0.21.

Fee: (0.05% + 0.15%) of $150 + $0.10 + $0.21

Fee = $0.30 + $0.10 + $0.21

Total Fee: $0.61

Transaction 2 (Rewards Card): A customer uses a rewards credit card; $800 order. The interchange rate for a rewards card is 1.8% + $0.10.

Fee: (1.8% + 0.15%) of $800 + $0.10 + $0.10

Fee = $14.40 + $1.20 + $0.20

Total Fee: $15.80

Transaction 3 (Premium Credit Card): A customer uses a premium credit card; $2000 order. The interchange rate for this transaction is 2.2% + $0.15.

Fee: (2.2% + 0.15%) of $2000 + $0.10 + $0.15

Fee = $44.00 + $3.00 + $0.25

Total Fee: $47.25

Monthly Cost: It is hard to provide an accurate monthly fee without knowing the specific breakdown of card types. Assuming that roughly 40% of transactions are debit card, 35% are rewards, and 25% are premium, we can assume the following calculation:

Monthly Volume: $20,000

Avg ticket: 

        380(380(
      
20,000/52.6)
Debit card transactions = 40% of 52.6 or roughly 21 transactions. Fees per transaction = $0.61. Total fees $12.81.

Rewards card transactions = 35% of 52.6 or roughly 18 transactions. Fees per transaction = $15.80. Total fees: $284.40.

Premium card transactions = 25% of 52.6 or roughly 13 transactions. Fees per transaction = $47.25. Total fees: $614.25.

Total monthly fees = $12.81 + $284.40 + $614.25 = $911.46

Total revenue = $20,000 - $911.46 = $19,088.54

Key Takeaways for Interchange-Plus:

Transparency: Tech Supplies has a clear view of the actual interchange costs and the processor's markup.

Potential Savings: Lower fees are possible on debit cards, but higher on premium cards.

Complexity: Tracking interchange categories and understanding rates can be challenging.

Fluctuations: Costs can fluctuate from month to month based on the card types used by their customers.

Example 5: Tiered Pricing

Scenario:

"Fashion Boutique," a clothing retailer that accepts phone orders, is considering a virtual terminal.

They process around $10,000 in sales per month with average order sizes from $50 to $500 and a mix of payment types.

Pricing Model:

The virtual terminal provider offers a tiered pricing model with the following categories and rates:

Qualified: 2.0% + $0.20 per transaction (mostly standard cards)

Mid-Qualified: 2.9% + $0.25 per transaction (some rewards cards, non-qualified scenarios)

Non-Qualified: 3.5% + $0.30 per transaction (premium cards, certain non-swipe scenarios)

How it Works:

Transaction 1 (Qualified): A customer uses a standard, non-rewards credit card; $100 order.

Fee: (2.0% of $100) + $0.20

Fee = $2.00 + $0.20

Total Fee: $2.20

Transaction 2 (Mid-Qualified): A customer uses a rewards card; $250 order.

Fee: (2.9% of $250) + $0.25

Fee = $7.25 + $0.25

Total Fee: $7.50

Transaction 3 (Non-Qualified): A customer uses a premium card; $400 order.

Fee: (3.5% of $400) + $0.30

Fee = $14.00 + $0.30

Total Fee: $14.30

Monthly Cost: Again it is difficult to provide an accurate monthly fee, but assuming that roughly 60% of transactions are qualified, 30% are mid-qualified and 10% are non-qualified, the costs can be estimated as follows:

Monthly Volume: $10,000

Avg ticket price: 

        227(227(
      
10,000 / 44)
Qualified transactions = 60% of 44 transactions or roughly 26 transactions. Total fee = $2.20. Total costs: $57.20.

Mid-qualified transactions = 30% of 44 transactions or roughly 13 transactions. Total fee = $7.50. Total costs: $97.50.

Non-qualified transactions = 10% of 44 transactions or roughly 5 transactions. Total fee = $14.30. Total costs: $71.50

Total monthly fees = $57.20 + $97.50 + $71.50 = $226.20.

Total revenue = $10,000 - $226.20 = $9,773.80

Key Takeaways for Tiered Pricing:

Complexity: The most significant challenge is the uncertainty of transaction tier qualification.

Lack of Transparency: It's difficult to know which cards will qualify for each tier until the actual transaction occurs.

Potential Costs: If many transactions fall into higher tiers (mid or non-qualified), fees can be much more expensive than flat-rate pricing.

Risk: It is difficult to accurately estimate transaction costs in advance, leading to budget uncertainty.

Important Considerations:

Interchange-Plus: Requires an understanding of interchange categories.

Tiered: Requires careful statement analysis to determine if your transactions are commonly falling into higher tiers.

Volume: Can be more cost effective for higher volumes, but also carry more risk.

Reporting: Your payment processor must provide detailed reporting and transparency about your transactions and related fees.

Transparency: Transparency is key, which means understanding your billing statement is critical.

Consistency: Understanding your transactions and how they consistently qualify can assist in understanding your overall processing costs.

In Summary:

These scenarios illustrate that interchange-plus and tiered pricing models add more complexity compared to a simple flat rate. Interchange-plus can be cost-effective if you have a lot of debit or regular credit cards, but difficult to manage if you do not understand interchange. Tiered pricing can be difficult to understand and may result in fluctuating, sometimes higher, processing fees.

Carefully evaluate your transaction volume, average transaction value, your customer payment mix, and the types of cards you are taking to choose a model that aligns best with your business needs and budget. Don't hesitate to ask your payment provider for clear explanations about their pricing model and how it will impact your overall costs.
