Two-Crew Approach for Enhanced Project Execution
This presentation outlines a two-crew structure designed to improve project outcomes through enhanced requirements analysis, technical architecture, and streamlined development.

Current Challenges (Implicit):

Potentially inefficient development due to unclear requirements or poorly defined architecture.
Possible rework or delays due to miscommunication or lack of upfront planning.
Proposed Solution: A Two-Crew Model

We propose implementing a two-crew system: a Discovery Crew and a Delivery Crew. This separation of responsibilities will allow for deeper analysis and more efficient execution.

1. Discovery Crew:

Focus: Discovery, research, analysis, customer journey mapping, and high-level architectural solution design.
Responsibilities:
Thorough requirements gathering and analysis.
Detailed customer journey mapping to understand user needs and pain points.
Creation of high-level architectural designs and technical specifications.
Prototyping and proof-of-concept development (if necessary).
Documentation of findings and recommendations.
Handover of comprehensive documentation to the Delivery Crew.
Key Deliverables:
Detailed Requirements Document
Customer Journey Maps
High-Level Architecture Diagrams
Technical Specifications
Proof-of-Concepts (if applicable)
2. Delivery Crew:

Focus: Development, testing, and deployment.
Responsibilities:
Development of the solution based on the specifications provided by the Discovery Crew.
Unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
Deployment to production and other environments.
Ongoing maintenance and support.
Key Deliverables:
Working Software/Application
Test Cases and Results
Deployment Scripts and Documentation
Maintenance and Support Documentation
Workflow and Timeline:

The Discovery Crew will operate on a lead schedule ahead of the Delivery Crew. This ensures that the Delivery Crew has all the necessary information and resources before starting development.

Phase 1: Discovery Phase (Discovery Crew): Requirements gathering, analysis, architecture design, and documentation.
Phase 2: Handover: Formal handover of documentation and specifications to the Delivery Crew.
Phase 3: Development Phase (Delivery Crew): Development, testing, and deployment based on the provided specifications.

Benefits of this Approach:

Improved Requirements Analysis: Dedicated focus on requirements gathering and analysis leads to a clearer understanding of project needs.
Enhanced Technical Architecture: Thorough architectural design ensures a robust and scalable solution.
Increased Development Efficiency: Clear specifications and documentation reduce ambiguity and rework during development.
Reduced Risk: Early identification of potential issues through thorough analysis minimizes project risks.
Better Communication: Clear handover process facilitates effective communication between the two crews.
Higher Quality Deliverables: Focus on quality at each stage of the process results in a higher quality final product.
Conclusion:

This two-crew approach offers a structured and efficient way to execute projects. By separating the discovery and delivery phases, we can ensure that projects are built on a solid foundation of well-defined requirements and robust architecture, leading to successful outcomes.

Next Steps:

Define specific roles and responsibilities within each crew.
Establish clear communication channels and processes.
Develop a detailed project plan with timelines and milestones.
This structure provides a strong framework. Remember to adapt it to your specific project needs. You can add slides for things like specific tools used by each team, key performance indicators for success, or example timelines for different project sizes.
