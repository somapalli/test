When defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for APIs in a Statement of Work (SOW) with a vendor, consider including the following metrics with specific target values to ensure clear expectations and measurable outcomes:

Response Time: Target an average response time of less than 500 milliseconds per request to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience.

Throughput: The API should be capable of handling at least 100 requests per second to adequately support expected load levels without performance degradation.

Availability/Uptime: Strive for an uptime of 99.9% ("three nines" standard), which is essential for maintaining high service reliability and minimizing downtime.

By setting these specific KPIs in your SOW, you will provide clear benchmarks for API performance, facilitating effective monitoring and evaluation of the vendorâ€™s service delivery.
