Component	Role	Resiliency
Load Balancer	Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers	Ensures no single server is a bottleneck or point of failure
API Gateway	Acts as a single entry point for all API requests	Provides rate limiting, request throttling, and authentication to maintain system stability
Microservices	Modular services handling specific business functions	Independently deployable and scalable, minimizing the impact of failures
Message Broker	Facilitates asynchronous communication between microservices	Decouples services, allowing independent operation and recovery from failures
Database Cluster	Stores and manages persistent data	Utilizes replication and sharding for high availability and quick data recovery
Caching Layer	Stores frequently accessed data	Provides faster data retrieval, reducing latency and improving user experience
Monitoring and Alerting	Continuously monitors system performance and health	Detects anomalies and triggers alerts for prompt issue response
Content Delivery Network (CDN)	Distributes content geographically closer to users	Reduces latency and ensures faster content delivery during high traffic periods
Resiliency Strategy	Description
Auto-scaling	Automatically adjusts resources based on current demand, ensuring consistent performance
Fault Tolerance	Implements redundancy and failover mechanisms to maintain operations during component failures
Disaster Recovery	Regular backups and plans to quickly restore services after catastrophic failures
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)	Facilitates rapid and reliable deployment of updates, reducing downtime risks
Circuit Breaker Pattern	Prevents cascading failures by temporarily blocking calls to failing services, allowing recovery
