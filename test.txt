The Problem:

Communication Gap: Your business analysis team is generating great work, but there's a disconnect when translating that analysis into clear, actionable requirements for stakeholders.
Lack of Stakeholder Alignment: Requirements aren't being finalized efficiently, likely due to incomplete communication or misunderstanding of stakeholder needs.
Delays in Approvals: The inability to close requirements is slowing down progress and decision-making.
Finding the Right Person:

Here are the qualities to look for in an individual who can fill this leadership role:

Business Analysis Background: A strong understanding of business analysis methodologies, requirements gathering techniques, and documentation practices.
Excellent Communication: The ability to translate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and vice versa. Must be adept at both verbal and written communication.
Stakeholder Management: Experience building relationships with stakeholders, understanding their needs, motivations, and effectively managing expectations.
Negotiation and Facilitation: Skills in leading discussions, resolving conflicts, and driving decision-making to obtain stakeholder approvals.
Project Management Understanding: While not a full project manager role, some knowledge of project timelines and the ability to prioritize tasks for efficiency is valuable.
