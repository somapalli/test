Here's how I'd adapt the PopID concept for your hackathon idea, focusing on card payments and ATMs, while keeping the idea device-free for convenience:
Project Title: FacePay: Secure, Hands-Free Payments and ATM Transactions
Problem Statement:
 * Traditional payment methods (cards, PINs) are prone to theft, fraud, and forgotten credentials.
 * ATMs often require physical card insertion, raising hygiene concerns and the risk of card skimming.
Solution Outline:
 * Integrate facial recognition software into existing payment terminals and ATM systems.
 * Secure user enrollment:
   * Capture facial data under controlled lighting to create high-quality templates.
   * Implement liveness detection (blinking, etc.) to prevent photo/video spoofing.
 * Encryption and secure storage of biometric data, potentially in decentralized ledgers.
Use Cases:
 * Card Payments:
   * Customer authenticates at the payment terminal with their face.
   * FacePay links to existing credit/debit cards within a secure user profile.
 * ATM Transactions:
   * User authenticates with facial recognition at the ATM.
   * No physical card needed for withdrawals, balance checks, etc.
Benefits:
 * Increased Security: Unique biometrics harder to steal than cards/PINs.
 * Convenience: Reduces lost card issues, no need to touch terminals/ATMs.
 * Enhanced Customer Experience:  Faster, frictionless transactions.
 * Potential for Loyalty Programs:  FacePay could integrate with reward systems for personalized offers.
Technology Stack Considerations
 * Facial Recognition Software: Evaluate open-source options (OpenCV, Dlib) or commercial providers specializing in high-accuracy, liveness-aware systems.
 * Secure Data Storage: Blockchain options for user-controlled data, or robust server-side encryption if centrally held.
 * Integrations: APIs for linking to banks and payment processors.
Hackathon Focus:
 * Proof of Concept: Demonstrate core facial authentication flow on a sample ATM/payment terminal.
 * Security Emphasis: Highlight encryption and anti-spoofing measures.
 * User Interface: Showcase a simple, streamlined enrollment and payment experience.
Let me know if you'd like to refine this further for your hackathon submission!
